## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements


## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- SASS

### What I learned

I learned little bit about how SASS works, this is my first project using it, so it's pretty bad, but I still like it since I have time to improve.

### Continued development

I will have to work on position: absolute, because I had to use this and I was really lost, so I will try to use it in more projects so I can focus on it and get better at working with it.

### Useful resources

- [tsbsankara - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/tsbsankara) - This guy's video helped me to learn little bit about the position: absolute, so I wasn't that frustrated. Thank you mate!
